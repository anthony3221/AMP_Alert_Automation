# AMP_Alert_Automation

This is a program developed in python. By making API calls to CISCO AMP software, it generates a report that contains
malware alert in the past 24 hours flagged by machine in UW - Madison Campus. It then notifies the departments
in the campus that own these machines which generate the alert by sending email. The program then inject these
data to a database in order to keep track of them.
